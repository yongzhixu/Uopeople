In Verne's book 'Five Weeks in a Balloon' he showed the reders a sotry about balloning (or in his own words, about africa). In that very book, the transport tool is a ever steering ballon and which only appeared in real life later. 
The scenes or tools one read in 'Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea' did not appeared in real life until last few decades, such as deep sea submarines which used in deep sea exploration. 
I believe Verne could not drive his imagination before he find some clues from his own life. Verne tried to convince others that his extensive research amount to the scitific accurancy, "even before I began writing stories, I always took numerous notes out of every book, newspaper, magazine, or scientific report that I came across" (Belloc & Marie, 1985).
However in Verne's case, scientific prophecy is not the prior in his mind while he tried to created the stories, it was quite a coincidence to him.
